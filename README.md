# Marine-Ship-Navigation-Simulinke-Model
This is the simulink model for different types of ships
The simulation of manuvering Fartoystyring is shown below. The first case is heading control, which requires the yaw angle (Psi) to follow a sine waves signal through PID control. The second case is speed control, which requires the forward speed (u) increase from 3m/s to 7m/s through a step signal at time 1200s. Also, keep the yaw angle stay at 0 rad. The control method is PID control.\
